# Litium.GraphQL
 Demonstrate how to query data in Litium using GraphQL

## Discalimer
This repo is only to show the idea of how to integrate GraphQL to Litium. It should not be used in production.

## Installation
The project is built against Litium 7.2.3. Even though it was not tested on other versions, it should work.
